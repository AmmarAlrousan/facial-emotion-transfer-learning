# Model Weights

This repository does not include trained model weights due to file size constraints.

## How to reproduce the model
You can reproduce the results by running the training notebook:
- `notebooks/fer_6class_xception.ipynb`

(Optional) If model checkpoints are generated during training, you may upload them externally (e.g., Google Drive / HuggingFace) and add the link here.

## Notes
- Architecture: Xception (Transfer Learning)
- Task: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER)
